# hello-world
This repository is created to support individuals who are new to coding.

My name is Nothando Mashiane. A young woman from Mpumalanga who would go above and beyond to assist anyone especially a woman. Growing up and seeing what our mothers and grandmothers went through inspired me to use or share everything/anything I have to empower women. This blog is all about empowering women and a glimpse of information or what I get up to in my life.

I do not wish women to have power over men; but over themselves.
